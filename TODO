            ✔ Write business logic (look here https://codepen.io/Em-Ant/full/QbRyqq/) @done(17-12-06 17:00)
                ✔ I am presented with a random series of button presses. @done(17-12-04 16:10)
                ✔ Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step. @done(17-12-04 16:10)
                ✔ I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button. @done(17-12-06 17:00)
                ✔ If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again. @done(17-12-04 16:10)
                ✔ I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses. @done(17-12-04 16:11)
                ✔ If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step. @done(17-12-04 16:11)
                ✔ I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses. @done(17-12-04 16:13)
                ✔ I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over. @done(17-12-04 16:13)

                ✔ When user failed inform about this (like here https://codepen.io/imtoobose/pen/KMgvBX?q=simon&limit=all&type=type-pens) @done(17-12-06 17:01)
                ✔ Some UI ideas from https://codepen.io/anthkris/pen/WGGAQz and here https://codepen.io/imtoobose/pen/KMgvBX?q=simon&order=popularity&depth=everything&show_forks=false @done(17-12-06 18:02)
